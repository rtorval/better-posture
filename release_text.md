# Better Posture v1.0.0

A posture reminder utility to promote ergonomic habits.

_"Sit smart. Move often. Feel better."_

Better Posture is a lightweight Windows system-tray utility designed to help you maintain healthy ergonomic habits throughout the day. It gently reminds you at customizable intervals to adjust your posture, stretch, or simply take a moment to reset — all without getting in your way.

## ✨ Features in v1.0.0

Single-Instance Protection
Ensures only one copy of Better Posture runs at a time.
